# Node_Note_Project
A simple note taking application made using Node.js with third party libraries. Look at the package.json file for third party libraries used.

This project was intended to help me learn about third-party packages using Node.js. I also wanted to learn how to use MongoDB. I was able to learn a lot about using Node.js and using MongoDB's cloud solution for a no-sql database.
